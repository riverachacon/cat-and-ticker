# Cat & Ticker

## Description

CatStock Finder is a simple web application that showcases a random cat image and allows users to search for their favorite stock information, it fetches and displays the stock's open-close data and the latest news about that stock using an external stock API. This app was initially built using Node.js with EJS templates and has now been converted to a React application.
